3.	### *Summary* ### 
Self taught front-end developer, who is able to realize projects from the ground up.

From the moment I produced “Hello World” in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been “just a job” for me, it’s offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple “Hello World” has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by.

I’m passionate about writing dynamic functional and clean code that looks great not only online, but in my code editor too.   

As an account manager at a travel company I have had a lot of opportunities to develop mo soft skills such as communication, organization and adaptability and I believe these would serve me and my employer will in future.


Below you'll find projects I've completed that showcase my skills and general background in developing software.
